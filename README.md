Included in this repository are NAMD job submission scripts for both IBM_jsrun and Slurm job management systems.

IBM_jsrun dir:
In this dir there is an optimized script for submitting NAMD jobs for system sizes of ~500,000 ATOMS.  As well as a wrapper for submitting multiple jobs in a dependent series.

Slurm:
In this dir there are job submission scripts that utilize the asinghar gpus as well as sripts that use agave's parallel nodes.
